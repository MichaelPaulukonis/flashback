![Image Filters]()

Flashback is a powerful image filtering web app that sends your photos back in time. 

Whether you're looking for chic 80s filters, want to add wear & tear, or want to add some 1920s glamour
to your pix, flashback has you covered.

Image filtering comprises vintage filters, solarizers, inverters, and over ninety more.

## Filters
- Vintage: 1920s chic, sepia, hazy vintage, perfumed imagery
- Wear & Tear: Make your images look like time's taken their toll on them. 
- 1980s: Bright, poppy filters.
- Retro: Reduced image quality, colour tints, and more.
- Cyberpunk: Some hacker-esque 1980s synthwavey filters are available. :eyes:

## Powered By
All the filters are processed with pure vanilla JS. No jQuery involved, either.
