Flashback is a powerful image filtering web app that sends your photos back in time. 

Whether you're looking for chic 80s filters, electric cyberpunk filters, or want to add some 1920s glamour
to your pics, Flashback has you covered.

Flashback contains 55 filters, with more on the way. 

## Flashback In Action
![Flashback can transform an image into a retro or vintage lookalike.](https://github.com/silvia-odwyer/flashback/blob/master/media/flashback-app-3.gif "Flashback can transform an image into a retro or vintage lookalike.")

Flashback can even transform a city into a scene from a cyberpunk film or a vintage city of the 1920s.
Take a look:

## Try It Out
Flashback is live here. 

## [TOFIX]
- Portrait images are only considered by the web app at the moment.
- Retaining aspect ratio of the image is on the way.

## Filters
- Vintage: 1920s chic, sepia, hazy vintage, perfumed imagery
- Wear & Tear: Make your images look like time's taken their toll on them. 
- 1980s: Bright, poppy filters.
- Retro: Reduced image quality, colour tints, and more.
- Cyberpunk: Some hacker-esque 1980s synthwavey filters are available. :eyes:

## Powered By
All the filters are processed with pure vanilla JS. No jQuery is involved, either.
